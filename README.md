# ExtractAssociatedIcon
A sample program (Windows Forms) that uses Windows Shell API's to extract multiple sizes of an EXE's icon.

This uses the technique discussed in Raymond Chen's blog post, [How do I get a high resolution icon for a file?](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140120-00/?p=2043)

Note that you can also specify the path of an Explorer Shortcut file (*.LNK) or any other file. 

This program also shows how to save the icon image as an ICO or PNG file.
